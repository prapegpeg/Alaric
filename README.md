🎙️ Alaric – Voice Command Mod for Gorilla Tag
Alaric is a fast, clean, and efficient voice command assistant mod for Gorilla Tag, built on BepInEx.
Inspired by classic assistants like Echo / Jarvis, Alaric lets you control gameplay, settings, players, and utilities hands-free using natural voice commands.
